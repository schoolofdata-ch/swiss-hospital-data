Swiss Hospital Data
---

This is a collaborative effort to establish a common data set about Swiss public medical infrastructure, where the community can contribute and manage data in a moderated way. Our goal is to improve the transparency and efficiency of data exchange about basic indicators, expanding on the existing available open government data.

This project was started at the [Monitoring COVID-19 effects](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/7#top) (#covid19mon) hackathon.

- Visit our [challenge page](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/68) for further details and tasks.
- At the top of the page you should see our current notes, which are [backed up here](NOTES.md).
- Please suggest additional data sources and ideas in the [issue tracker](issues).
